Project Title: Real Estate Web Application
 
Objective.
This project will help you to get a taste of software project management skills firsthand. You will follow the Agile development approach; take advantage of GitHub distributed version control plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis to support your project management process.  The project is divided into 4 incrementally deliveries which we refer to as sprints based on Agile Scrum methodology, which will be used in this course.

The duration of the project is 10 to 12 weeks; the development process is an adapted Agile with 3 to 4 weeks long iterations, 4 iterations in total. The first 2 weeks of the first sprint are for training and setting up your development environment. 

Because of the short span of this project, you are not expected to deliver a marketable product, but the result should be at least a compelling middle-fidelity prototype that could serve as the basis for building a real product.

Description.
A real estate web application is a digital platform designed to facilitate the buying, selling, and renting, of real estate properties. These applications offer a wide range of features and functionalities to streamline the entire real estate transaction process, making it more convenient and efficient for users. 

We identify four primary users: Homebuyers, Property renters,  system administrator(s), and (real-state) brokers. Homebuyers search for properties to buy.  They can request a visit to the broker managing the unit.  They have different criteria to search for properties, including filtering by price range; the number of rooms; living and lot area dimensions; time in the market; building type; year built, etc.  They can also search for brokers, or use a calculator to estimate the monthly payment of a property of their interest.  Property renters are individuals or families seeking rental accommodations.  They can use similar search criteria as homebuyers, and they can also request visits to a property.
The system administrator is responsible for adding/removing brokers.  The brokers manage their own property listings.  Brokers can also make purchase offers to properties listed by other brokers.

List of main use cases organized by user type.

Homebuyer
Search for a property: The homebuyer can search for properties based on specific criteria such as location, price range, number of bedrooms, and amenities.
Save favorites: Homebuyers can save properties they are interested in, creating a list of favorites for easy access and comparison. 
Request a visit to a property: Once interested in a property, the homebuyer can request a viewing appointment through the system

This is not an exhaustive list of features/users. Other kinds of users and features could be considered. Your project grade criteria consider originality and innovation.  The highest marks will be given to teams who are thinking out of the box and include other users and functionalities for eventual implementation when properly justified. 

For the first sprint, you have to consider the following core features:
Search for properties
Requests for visits to properties
CRUD operations on properties
CRUD operations on brokers

You must have regular meetings with your team and post their “minutes” in the corresponding subfolder in your repository.
At the end of each sprint, each team member will submit a detailed log of their activities, which will be considered to evaluate the individual contribution.
