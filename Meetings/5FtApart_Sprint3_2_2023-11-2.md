since he is a very hard and smart worker 

Peizhe is still in the process of separating the login and signup pages in order to ensure efficiency if ever accessing
those individual pages are needed

Thomas was able to modify the submit offer page but forgot to implement the necessary information for a broker 
to fill up

Charles is still watching videos in order to link the signup page to the database 

The team also had a small meeting during the lab session when the demo took place
