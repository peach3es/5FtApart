# Meeting Minutes

## Attendees: Peizhe, Patrick, Thomas, Zhan Jun, Charles, Alex

Charles, Peizhe and Alex were online instead due to some unforseen situations

Thomas was able to change the formatting for the submit offer page. He added the necessary info that was posted
along the Sprint 3 document, which were the broken information for the promise to purchase form in the frontend portion

Zhan Jun was able to finish the brokers page where all brokers are going to be shown, with the help of Peizhe.
They added the search bar as well.

Charles was able to complete the backend portion for the searching of brokers. With the help of Peizhe and Alex, they were able to search for a specific 
broker using the name. 
Charles was also able to implement the backend portion of the signup where the user can sign up, either as a normal client or as a broker. Peizhe also helped
in this case. 

Patrick was able to implement unit testing and is in the process of finishing all test cases. 

Zhan Jun, along with Patrick decided to work on the documentation such as the logs, user stories and planning for Sprint 4. 

Charles is still keeping in check of meeting minutes

Alex was able to do extravagant work in the login page by using an authentication system. No user can create the same profile with the same email. 
Not only that, he was also able to make sure that the user can log in and log out but also, that when a user is created, only a broker can access certain pages. 

Peizhe on the other hand, styled multiple pages as well with his artistic creativity. He recolored the whole website to match the teams logo color palette.
